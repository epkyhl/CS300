### Problem to be solved
ABCUniversity wanted their computer science program courses to be printed in alphanumeric order along with being able to print the title of a course and its prerequisites. To do this, I implemented a data structure, in this case vectors, to hold and sort the set of courses so they could be printed in some order. This also allowed for the ability to search through the courses and print a specific one along with the prerequisites. 

### Working on this project
In working on this project, the hardest part really was getting started in the first place. Having a 295 line final draft was pretty easy but seeing a whole project in front of me seemed a little intimidating. To help me get started, I rather heavily relied on my past work and what we had already turned in, like the vector sorting assignment, to make sure I felt confident in what I was doing. Completing this project not only gave me more experience with the structures that are so commonly used now in modern programming, but also allowed me to feel how starting a program from scratch is like. In being virtually by myself and the work I had done to this point, I had to make sure my program made sense to anyone who would review it, including myself!
